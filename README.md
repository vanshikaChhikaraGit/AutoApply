## Why choose auto apply?
Our extension is designed for university students applying for on-campus placements. Often the TnP cell provides students with a google form to fill that contains repetitive information but any already available chrome extension in marketplace does not provide auto-filling of google forms also their data is not tailored according to university forms so students end up filling the same thing multiple time and wasting thier time. This problem is solved by AUTO APPLY. Any kind of form google form, website form etc is catered to by Auto Apply!
